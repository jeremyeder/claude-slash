## Security Considerations

### Command Execution
- All commands are executed in your local environment
- Commands run with your user permissions
- No external network calls without explicit user consent
- All data stays local to your git repository

### Safe Command Design
Commands in this repository are designed to be safe:
- No destructive operations (rm -rf, format, etc.)
- No privilege escalation (sudo, su, etc.)
- No automatic execution of downloaded code
- No hardcoded credentials or secrets

### Data Privacy
- Checkpoint data is stored locally in your git repository
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- Session information includes only basic environment details
- No sensitive information is captured or stored

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do NOT** open a public issue
2. Email security concerns to: [jeremy.eder@gmail.com]
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if available)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
- Review command implementations before installation
- Only install commands from trusted sources
- Keep your git repository private if it contains sensitive data
- Regularly review checkpoint files for any sensitive information

### For Contributors
- Never include hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Avoid commands that could harm the user's system
- Use safe shell practices (proper quoting, error handling)
- Test commands in isolated environments first
